# LoginWithNebulas
A 2FA Nebulas based login site

# Use
When implented on a website as a second layer of authentication, Login With Nebulas allows to used to safely login to their accounts by proving ownership of a Nebulas account.

Users will need to have [this extension](https://github.com/ChengOrangeJu/WebExtensionWallet) in chrome in order to use the site.

It is recommended that the site require a user to give their Nebulas public key on sign up or when activating Login With Nebulas for the first time.

# Implementation
I will be releasing an example website that uses Login With Nebulas in the coming days
